              HI,I'M RAMYA SARASWATHI.R
           </h1>
           <p>
              I am currently pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Engineering at RIT. I have a strong interest in web development because it combines creativity with logical thinking—an ideal blend that truly inspires me.
              In 12th grade, I achieved a 95% score, and that determination continues to drive me as I advance in my technical skills. I enjoy exploring both front-end and back-end technologies and constantly strive to improve my abilities.
              Every aspect of web development excites me—from designing intuitive user interfaces to building powerful back-end systems. I’m passionate about creating websites that are both functional and visually engaging.
